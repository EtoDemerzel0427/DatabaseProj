# DatabaseProj

This repository is for the course project for our database interterm, a flask-based web app. 

The group members include: Weiran Huang, Zengrui Wang, Zhi Wang.

The project is now finished. It is not a perfect version because it is done in only a couple of days, during which we spent a lot of efforts learning Flask from scratch.

 Before running the `run.py`ï¼Œ you have to create the database first. The SQL scripts are in the `sql` folder, but forgive us for any possible omission, since sometimes we may fail to save the executed SQL file. :) And don't forget to change the hardcoded path for database to your own.
